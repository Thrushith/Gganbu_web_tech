            <p> Keep Calm and the Database will handle it. Very smart people are often tricked by hackers, by phishing. I don't exclude myself from that. It's about being smarter than a hacker. Not about being smart.( "To Err is Human, To restore is DBA " I like to work on DBA and ethical hacking , right now i am working on SQL and a whole bunch about it , i am also aware of the data base management system and also have some knowledge regarding the data warehousing. The tool I use for exploitation is METASPLOIT framework.My final Goal is to become a DBA and Manage Cloud)</p>

        <p> If you wanna know how not secure you are, just take a look around. Nothing's secure. Nothing's safe. I don't hate technology, I don't hate hackers, because that's just what comes with it, without those hackers we wouldn't solve the problems we need to solve, especially security.(Currently into Ethical hacking And Deep Learning. My final goal is to become a Professional Ethical Hacker.)</p>

        <p> Machine learning modeling and testing on sample data and going through the business user acceptance test can surprise you! And it will definitely make you to rethink on your feature selection and data sampling methods.(Currently into Machine Learning and Deep Learning. My final goalis to become a Data Scientist and Working on huge data sets.That typical rush which occurs when you build something to reduce your metal work on your daily basis is the primary thing which keeps me attached with programming and computers.)</p>

        <p> Robotics, manufacturing, medicine, farming, energy - all will be pushed to and beyond their limits and, by so doing, will advance at speeds far faster than without the impetus and challenge of opening a frontier - thus also raising the odds of survival in our favor.(currently itno AI and Deep Learning.

        <p> Computers are getting pretty good lately. A small chip can pretty much do anything. But the important thing is the person who programmed the chip.. so I want to be the person who'll be able to do such thing. That's what made me like computers and programming.(My final goal is to become a Robtoic and graphics Designer)</p>
